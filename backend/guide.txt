1️
Controllers (MVC Layer)
The controllers are responsible for accepting requests and invoking the appropriate commands or queries.

AuthController.cs: Handles user authentication.
StocksController.cs: Handles stock-related requests.
UsersController.cs: Manages user actions (e.g., register, update).
OrdersController.cs: Handles stock order requests (buy/sell).


2️
CQRS (Command and Query Layers)

Commands (Write Operations)
CreateUserCommand.cs: A command to create a new user.
BuyStockCommand.cs: A command to place a buy order for stocks.
SellStockCommand.cs: A command to place a sell order for stocks.

Queries (Read Operations)
GetStockHistoryQuery.cs: A query to fetch stock price history.
GetPortfolioQuery.cs: A query to fetch the user's portfolio.
GetUserByEmailQuery.cs: A query to fetch user details by email.


3️
Service Layer
Each service encapsulates the logic for handling both commands and queries. The services use the repositories to interact with the database.

AuthService.cs: Manages the authentication logic, including JWT token generation.
StockService.cs: Manages stock-related business logic (e.g., calculating stock price, checking availability).
UserService.cs: Manages user-specific logic (e.g., user creation, password hashing).
TradeOrderService.cs: Manages trade orders (buying and selling).


4️
Repositories
Repositories handle the interaction with the database through the Entity Framework or another ORM.

UserRepository.cs: Queries and updates user-related data.
StockRepository.cs: Queries and updates stock-related data.
TradeOrderRepository.cs: Handles stock trade orders.


5️
JWT Middleware
JwtMiddleware.cs: Middleware to authenticate requests using JWT tokens.


6️
Data Layer (ApplicationDbContext.cs)
The ApplicationDbContext.cs connects to your database, managing the entities and migrations.
