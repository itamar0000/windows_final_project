Help me with my Stock Portfolio Management System project for my Windows Systems Engineering course. The project involves creating a Desktop Application using PySide6 and integrating it with a .NET Core Application Server via CQRS/MVC patterns. 
The system must manage stock portfolios, allowing users to place buy/sell orders, view order history, and monitor their portfolio. It integrates with APIs like Polygon.io for stock data and Cloudinary for image storage.
Additionally, I need to incorporate an AI Advisor using an Ollama Docker Server with RAG for financial guidance. 
The app will use QtCharts for graphs, cloud-based data storage with Event Sourcing on Somee.com, and follow the Gateway Design Pattern for external service communication.
I might also explore deploying the Application Server to the cloud and using
 Cloudinary for advanced image transformations. I’d like help with
[specific task or part of the project],
 or guidance on how to approach implementing certain components or patterns.
